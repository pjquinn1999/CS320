The provided code demonstrates several key principles for creating functional and secure software. First, it shows robust input validation and error handling, which are crucial for security and reliability. The Contact class validates all input parameters, ensuring that contact IDs, names, phone numbers, and addresses meet specific format requirements. This prevents invalid data from entering the system and potentially causing issues downstream.The code also illustrates good software design through separation of concerns. The Contact class handles individual contact data and validation, while the ContactService class manages the collection of contacts and operations on them. This separation makes the code more maintainable and easier to test. The comprehensive test suites (ContactTest and ContactServiceTest) demonstrate the importance of thorough testing, covering both valid and invalid scenarios for each component. Interpreting user needs is reflected in how the requirements were translated into concrete features. The system appears designed for a use case where users need to manage contact information with specific constraints (like phone numbers being exactly 10 digits). The ContactService provides a clean API with intuitive methods (add, delete, update) that map directly to user operations. The error messages are clear and user-friendly, helping users understand what went wrong when they provide invalid input. As for designing software, some things that can be done are immutable IDs for data integrity, encapsulation by making fields private and providing controlled access, defensive programming through input validation, and Single Responsbility Principle where each class has a designated purpose.
